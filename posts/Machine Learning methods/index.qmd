In recent years, machine learning models have become increasingly popular for predicting EV energy consumption, particularly in urban transportation scenarios where driving conditions are highly variable. Unlike physics-based or traditional statistical approaches, machine learning models learn patterns directly from data and do not rely on strong assumptions about the underlying relationships between variables [1]. This makes them well suited for capturing the complexity of real-world driving behavior.

A wide range of machine learning techniques has been applied to EV energy consumption modeling. Common approaches include tree-based models such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, as well as neural networks, which are capable of learning nonlinear relationships between energy consumption and input features like speed, acceleration, traffic conditions, road characteristics, and weather [1]. These models often achieve higher prediction accuracy than traditional methods, especially when large and diverse datasets are available.

One key advantage of machine learning models is their ability to handle high-dimensional and nonlinear data. Urban driving involves frequent stop-and-go behavior, varying traffic density, and complex interactions between variables, all of which can be difficult to model using simpler approaches [1]. Machine learning models can automatically learn these interactions, leading to improved performance in many practical applications.

At the same time, recent research has placed increasing emphasis on model interpretability, especially in the context of transportation and energy systems. Interpretable machine learning techniques, such as feature importance measures and partial dependence analysis, help identify which factors contribute most to EV energy consumption and how they influence predictions [1]. Improving interpretability not only builds trust in model outputs but also provides valuable insights for system design, policy-making, and driving behavior analysis, making machine learning models more useful beyond pure prediction tasks.

However, machine learning models also come with trade-offs. They often require large amounts of high-quality data and can be more difficult to interpret than statistical models or vehicle dynamics approaches [1]. As a result, researchers increasingly focus on balancing predictive accuracy with interpretability, depending on whether the model is intended for real-time prediction, system planning, or policy analysis.
